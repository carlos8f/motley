[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/motley.png?downloads=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/motley/)

## Introduction

Cyberpunking the internets. That's what you should be doing right now, and the Motley node.js framework makes it easy! Lovingly crafted in an efficient Model-View-Controller style, Motley combines the best tools for making websites:

- [schemaless, portable data layer](https://www.npmjs.org/package/modeler)
- [Handlebars views](https://www.npmjs.org/package/templ)
- [express-compatible](https://github.com/cpsubrian/node-expres)
  [middleware and controllers](https://www.npmjs.org/package/middler)
- [file server with in-memory cache](https://www.npmjs.org/package/buffet)
- [intelligent gzip compression and e-tag support](https://www.npmjs.org/package/dish)
- [session persistence and authentication](https://github.com/carlos8f/sess)
- [auto-loadable "plugin" application structure](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/cd931ba95481a7570602)

...with stupidly awesome gist integration, allowing you to kickstart a prototype or venture into complete application development, all with just a couple shell commands.

It's worth noting that if you're coming from [express.js](http://expressjs.com/), Motley emulates many express/connect features, such as middleware, views, and sessions. In most cases, you'll be able to use your favorite connect/express middleware and port your apps with ease.

## Installation

`$ npm install -g motley`

## Famous two-line bootstrap

```
$ motley-init my-project 
$ motley my-project
server running at http://localhost:3000/
```

## One-line gist creation

```
$ motley-init --gist [--public] [--open] [my-project]
```

This will:

- prompt you for your github credentials, which are then exchanged
  for an [access token](https://www.npmjs.org/package/gist-cli) and cached at `~/.gist-login`
- create a gist containing [a new motley project](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/b7d6f5b60306e63da635), optionally public with `--public`
- check out the gist's git repo via ssh, giving you version control
- optionally open your browser and point it to the gist with `--open`

Then you have a brand new web app, runnable with the `motley` binary, tied to a private git repo, backed by [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/), and all you had to do was type `motley-init`!

Simply run `motley` in the project directory, the web server will start, and edit the source code to do what you want!

## Examples

[Example apps](https://github.com/carlos8f/motley/tree/master/example) using Motley:

- [the &ldquo;hello world&rdquo; app](https://github.com/carlos8f/motley/tree/master/example/hello-world)
- [simple blog with in-memory database](https://github.com/carlos8f/motley/tree/master/example/blog)
- [simple blog with LevelDB persistence, as a gist](https://gist.github.com/carlos8f/b7d6f5b60306e63da635)
- [a mini app](https://github.com/carlos8f/motley/tree/master/example/minimal)

## Mistakes

motley mistakes

- just being in the filesystem shouldn't mean it's "enabled"
- binded to modeler
- comes with some useless stuff, old versions of request, etc
- binary thing is weird (invisible dependency, unable to introduce breaking changes to binary)
- namespace is (hard to explain and) shared between all types, levels
- too many watchers
- too much buffering of static resources
- no unmount method, or async mount method
- leveldb :(
- conf is conflated with "main entry point"
  - hard to make scripts
  - hard to have multiple confs
- gist stuff probably isn't popular (motivation for flexible layout thing)
- no clustering
- no separation of plugin system vs. web server (scripts)
- weird that sessions and users models are built-in
- glob patterns are sloopy


goals

- eliminate in-memory caching
- allow plugins to respond to unmount/remount
- should be no dependence on database
- traditional dependency based instead of -g binary
