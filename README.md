## Idea

Motley is an "alternative" framework whose goal is to bundle independently usable
modules into a cohesive workflow for rapid website development. You won't see any
monolithic implementations going on here. Think of it as a starter kit for your
app, and a plugin-centric pattern of development.

## Featured modules

- [middler](https://github.com/carlos8f/node-middler) - http router and middleware runner
- [buffet](https://github.com/carlos8f/node-buffet) - static asset server
- [templ](https://github.com/carlos8f/templ) - renderer for handlebars-based templates
- [expres](https://github.com/cpsubrian/node-expres) - Express.js compatibility layer
- [sess](https://github.com/carlos8f/sess) - session handler
- [haredis](https://github.com/carlos8f/haredis) - high-availability redis client
- [modeler](https://github.com/carlos8f/modeler) - schemaless db-agnostic entity
  system ([redis store](https://github.com/carlos8f/modeler-redis) used by default)

Several useful utilities are also packaged including
[dish](https://github.com/carlos8f/node-dish),
[formidable](https://github.com/felixge/node-formidable),
[glob](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) and
[request](https://github.com/mikeal/request).

## Bootstrap

When you initially `require('motley')` from your app, you get three things:

1. `app`: Motley exports a global (singleton) app object, so there's no need to
  create it. It's also an `EventEmitter` if you like sort kind of thing.
2. `app.boot(cb)`: Reads `./conf.yml` or `./conf.json` (if exists) and puts the
   parsed result on `app.conf`. Also reads `./package.json` (if exists) and puts
   that on `app.pkg`. Calls `cb` after, with an `err` if anything went wrong.
3. `app.motley()`: Synchronously loads all of Motley's built-in plugins, middleware
   and your app's plugins and middleware on `app`, in that order.

### Example `server.js`:

```js
var app = require('motley');

app.boot(function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  // (if we have any core overrides, they go here)
  app.motley();
  // (this is where we call app.server.listen(), if this is a web app)
});
```

Note that unlike other frameworks, Motley will NOT call `listen()` on the server
for you. Your app MUST call `app.server.listen()` to serve requests! This allows
you to

- use port registries such as [amino](https://github.com/amino/amino) or
  [seaport](https://github.com/substack/seaport)
- handle the `listening` event however you want
- re-use your plugins/models in CLI/cron situations when activating the server
  would be undesirable
- use an app as a plugin inside another app - "appception"!

## Plugin system

You can always get a reference to your app by `var app = require('motley')`, even
from inside the `node_modules` tree (by using Motley as a peer-depenency). This
allows you to interact with the app's runtime from any module! Creating a plugin
is as easy as:

1. create a `package.json` and add `motley` to
   [peerDependencies](http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/02/07/peer-dependencies/)
2. use `var app = require('motley')` and expose an API on `app`
3. `require('my-plugin')` from your app

## Overriding core

If you don't like some core plugin or middleware, you can usually override it by
loading a plugin with the same API between when you call `app.boot()` and
`app.motley()`:

```js
var app = require('motley')
  , https = require('https')

app.boot(function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  app.server = https.createServer(app.conf.https);
  app.motley();
  // now we're using https instead of http!
});
```

For a minimal (or highly customized) setup, you also don't even have to call
`app.motley()`, just require the parts you want and run with it:

```js
var app = require('motley');

app.boot(function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;
  require('motley/plugins/load');
  app.load('./plugins');
  // etc
});
```
